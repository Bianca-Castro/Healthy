###    Ingredients

- 2 cups white, spelt, or oat flour (240g)

- 1 tsp baking soda

- 3/4 tsp baking powder

- 3/4 tsp salt

- optional 1/2 tsp cinnamon

- optional 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

- 1 1/2 cup mashed overripe banana (360g)

- 1/2 cup yogurt, such as almondmilk yogurt

- 1/2 cup pure maple syrup, honey, or agave

- 2 tbsp any sweetener of choice OR 1/16 tsp uncut stevia

- 1/3 cup oil OR milk of choice

- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract

  ### Instructions

  - *Also be sure to try this recipe for [Banana Muffins](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2019/02/21/banana-muffins-recipe-best/)!

    Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a 9×5 loaf pan, or line with parchment. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. Whisk liquid ingredients in a separate bowl. Pour wet into dry, and stir to form a batter. Smooth into the prepared pan. If desired, press some chocolate chips into the top. Bake on the center rack 40 minutes, then *do not* open the oven door but turn off the heat and let sit in the closed oven 10 additional minutes. If your bread is still undercooked at this time, simply turn the oven back on and continue baking—checking every 5 minutes–until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Taste and texture are much better the second day (and even better the third day as it gets sweeter). Leftovers can be sliced and frozen for up to a month. If you try the recipe, be sure to rate it below!
